    <h2>Definition and Composition</h2>
    <p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world. Located between
      Hawaii and California, it spans an area estimated to be twice the size of Texas. Contrary to the idea of a solid
      floating island, it consists of a dispersed collection of plastics and debris suspended in the water column, held
      together by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.</p>

    <h2>Formation and Sources</h2>
    <p>The GPGP was formed as a result of oceanic currents that trap floating debris. Much of this plastic originates
      from land-based sources and is transported into the ocean via rivers, winds, and coastal runoff. Over time, these
      plastics accumulate, drawn into the gyre where they can remain for decades due to the durability of plastic
      materials.</p>

    <h2>Statistics and Scale</h2>
    <p>Research published in 2018 estimates that the patch contains approximately 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic,
      weighing around 80,000 metric tons. These materials range from large fishing nets and crates to tiny microplastics
      formed through the breakdown of larger items. This pollution poses a growing threat to marine life and ocean
      health.</p>
